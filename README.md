# VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators) : Template for Student Projects
GitHub repository of Patrik Jozefoviƒç for projects in the university course VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators).

## Description - Seminar Paper:

The seminar paper focuses mainly on the topic of robotics in medical applications.

## Description - Project 1:
Main focus of this project is on better knowledge of ABB RS. Main task of this project was to create an simulation of two robotic arms with conveyour, where user can select colour of the blocks, present in the simulation, which will be picked up. After user selects the colour, robotic arm picks the blocks of corresponding colour and put them on the conveyour. After both blocks are loaded onto conveyour inside of a table, the conveyour moves blocks to a second location, where after blocks are detected with sensor, second arm put blocks inside of a box and seal the box with a lid. Then, arms are returned into home position and program ends.

## Description - Project 2:

Further information will be added in following weeks.
