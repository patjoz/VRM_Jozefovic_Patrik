Dear user,

in this folder you can find PACK&GO file of ABB RS with completed Project 1 which was focused on control of two separate robotic arms connected with conveyour. Based on users input, first arm selectively picks blocks of selected colour and put it onto conveyour, then blocks in table are transported until they reach sensor on the conveyour end, where second arm puts them into the box and also put lid on the box.

If you want to see how the program works, videos can be found in subfolder.
