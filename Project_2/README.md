## Description

Simulation was created in ABB RobotStudio, for further details, check [presentation](https://github.com/patjoz/VRM_Jozefovic_Patrik/blob/main/Project_2/Description/Project_02_Automated_Medical_Laboratory.pdf) or [video](https://github.com/patjoz/VRM_Jozefovic_Patrik/blob/main/Project_2/Demo%20Video/Project2_Automated_medical_lab_demo.exe).

The main goal of this project was to simulate first steps with the blood and urine samples in hospital lab. We successfuly simulated reception desk, where robotic arm separates blood and urine samples which undergo different examinations. Blood samples are then sent to the second part of lab, where they are put into a centrifuge to separate plasma from red and white cells. Urine, on the other hand is directly put into the stand and the cover is removed so that lab technician can focus on microscopic examination.
